# tongue-but-hole

So funny story I was planning on generating a page per message so I could have a cool og image and meta tags for each message and it would be there in the embed whenever you shared it.

Slight problem with that though, there's like 846 million possible combinations. 25 templates, 368 words, and 10 conjunctions.

846,400,000 to be exact. (851,006,250 for me because I included "tongue" for the memes)

So fuck that because even if I got my html down to 1kb I'm still looking at at least a terabyte of html files and I'm not paying bezos any money to host that shit in an s3 bucket.

hmmm any chance I could yeet all that onto ipfs for free? web3 where you at??

That was a joke, it would be slow as balls and web3 is dumb. don't @ me

There is no useful information in this readme. I made this app like I played elden ring. My own damn way. I used spells and summons for EVERYTHING don't @ me. However I did play the whole game with the simp debuff as penance.

Read the source like you would play elden ring. Completely on your own except also using the internet. Shout out to the [edlen ring wiki](https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Messages) I couldn't have done it without you.
